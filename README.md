# Capstone_project

Project I want to work on: 

ABOUT: It's a social media/ discussion app for novel readers. Especially for readers who are currently reading the book. Each book in the app would have a community on its own where depending on the length of the book (interms of chapters), there would be a discussion channel for every/everyfew chapters for readers to engage in conversations. Spoilars would be allowed till that chapter limit. Targeted audience is people who read english translated books from other countries.

Tools: Scrape good reads or MTL novel website using python: BeautifulSoup. 



Other projects I would be interested in:

- Any game project preferably using C++, swift UI, JS game engine or python. (I'm fine with any other languages as well, I can learn qiickly if I don't know)
- Any app project for IOS users using swift or swift UI (only)
- Any projects in C++
